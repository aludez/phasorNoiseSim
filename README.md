This currently works in ROOT 5, have not tested in ROOT 6.
Usage in command line:

root
.L toyModelImproved.C+

from here you can call the function phasorModel(*args).  phasorModel outputs two .root files containing TTrees filled with traces generated from the number of phasors and geometry specified.

The inputs to phasorModel are:
dist_name - a string that gets appeded to the output root files
ant_sep - the separation between antenna feeds
phasor_num - the number of phasors that generate each trace
geometry - a string ("shell" or "box") that determines the layout where the phasors come from
traces - number of waveforms that go into the TTree
antenna_type - a string ("vpol", "lba" or "hba") that picks what antenna frequency response to use. "vpol" is ara vpol.

The outputs of phasorModel are:
two .root files containing TTrees filled with TGraphs of the traces generated by this simulation.

At the bottom I put a function called doAll() with some phasorModel called a bunch of times with the settings I used to make the correlation vs spacing plot in the paper
# phasorNoiseSim
